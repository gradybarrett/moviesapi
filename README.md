[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/nickcharlton/moviesapi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/nickcharlton/moviesapi)

Accessing movie data and up-to-date cinema listings is unreasonably hard.

[Find any Film][] was originally funded by the UK Film Council. In [an article from
way back in 2009][guardian] they describe that an "API will also be rolled out that
will allow developers to build applications around this unique and rich data set".
I guess that never happened, then.

This is a quick-and-dirty API that screenscrapes Find any Film and was
implemented to provide a cinemas and film showings data source for
[YRS i-DAT's 2013 project][yrs].

It's a simple [Sinatra][] application, using [Nokogiri][] for HTML/XML parsing. It's
very similar to the [UrbanScraper][] API I built previously.

## Usage

The main version is hosted on [Heroku][], so it follows the conventions there. But
to run locally:

```bash
foreman start
```

Go to: http://localhost:4000/.
